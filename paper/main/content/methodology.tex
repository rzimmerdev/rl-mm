\subsection{Problem Definition}
\label{subsec:problem-definition}

The market-making problem addressed in this work involves designing an optimal trading policy for an agent using reinforcement learning.
The policy should be able to balance profit and risk, particularly inventory risk under the restriction of having zero inventory at market close,
and interacts with the environment by quoting bid and ask prices and adjusting offered quantities.
The environment dynamics are modeled by an underlying limit order book (LOB) and its behaviour will be described in the following sections.
The agent's objective is to maximize cumulative rewards over time, while minimizing inventory risk and market impact costs.
