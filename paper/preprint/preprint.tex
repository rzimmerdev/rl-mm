    \begin{abstract}
        Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a promising framework for developing adaptive and data-driven strategies,
        enabling market makers to optimize decision-making policies based on interactions with the limit order book environment.
        This paper explores the integration of a reinforcement learning agent in a market-making context,
        where the underlying market dynamics have been explicitly modeled to capture observed stylized facts of real markets,
        including clustered order arrival times, non-stationary spreads and return drifts, stochastic order quantities and price volatility.
        These mechanisms aim to enhance stability of the resulting control agent,
        and serve to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the agent policy learning process.
        Our contributions include a practical implementation of a market making agent based on the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm,
        alongside a comparative evaluation of the agent's performance under varying market conditions via a simulator-based environment.
        As evidenced by our analysis of the financial return and risk metrics when compared to a closed-form optimal solution,
        our results suggest that the reinforcement learning agent can effectively be used under non-stationary market conditions,
        and that the proposed simulator-based environment can serve as a valuable tool for training and
        pre-training reinforcement learning agents in market-making scenarios.
