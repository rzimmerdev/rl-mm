\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

The market-making problem addressed in this work involves designing an optimal trading policy for an agent using reinforcement learning.
The policy should be able to balance profit and risk, particularly under a market impact cost model,
with non-stationary dynamics and a complex state transition function.
The environment dynamics are modeled by an underlying limit order book (LOB) and
the details of the state transition operator and the process of obtaining the optimal decision policy to maximize cumulative rewards over time
are described in the following sections.
