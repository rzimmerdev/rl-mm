\begin{abstract}
    Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a promising framework for developing adaptive and data-driven strategies,
    enabling market makers to optimize decision-making policies based on interactions with the limit order book environment.
    This paper explores the integration of a reinforcement learning agent in a market-making context,
    where the underlying market dynamics have been explicitly modeled to capture observed stylized facts of real markets,
    including clustered order arrival times, non-stationary spreads and return drifts, stochastic order quantities and price volatility.
    These mechanisms aim to enhance stability of the resulting control agent,
    and serve to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the agent policy learning process.

    Our contributions include a practical implementation of a market making agent based on the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm,
    alongside a comparative evaluation of the agent's performance under varying market conditions via a simulator-based environment.
    As evidenced by our analysis of the financial return and risk metrics when compared to a closed-form optimal solution,
    our results suggest that the policy gradient-based agents can effectively be used under non-stationary market conditions,
    and that the proposed simulated environment can serve as a valuable tool for training and
    pre-training reinforcement learning agents in market-making scenarios.
